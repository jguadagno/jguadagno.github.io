A few weeks ago, I embarked on a task to move one of my sites from a traditional hosting provider to [Windows Azure](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/) [Web Sites](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/scenarios/web-sites/). I did this for a few reasons and it has **nothing** to do with the hosting provider.

1. I was helping out at one of Global Windows Azure Boot Camps, so I felt I should see what it’s like first hand.
2. The site I moved needed to be able to scale up on certain days/weeks.
3. I’m a geek and wanted a new “toy” to play with.

This blog post is the first in a few that will talk about the different parts of the overall "Migration”

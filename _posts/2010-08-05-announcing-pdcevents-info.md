Back a while ago, I created a site to track events at the Microsoft MVP Global Summit. I did this because there are so many after parties or events that happen at this summit as well as other conferences.  Well I put up a site to track events at the [Microsoft Professional Developers Conference](http://www.microsoftpdc.com "Microsoft PDC"){:target="_blank"} (PDC), it is [PDCEvents.info](http://bit.ly/PDCEvents){:target="_blank"}

Check it out. I have already added the events two events to the site. **  
Welcome Reception**: [http://bit.ly/pdc_1](http://bit.ly/pdc_1){:target="_blank"}**  
Attendee Party**:[http://bit.ly/pdc_2](http://bit.ly/pdc_2){:target="_blank"}

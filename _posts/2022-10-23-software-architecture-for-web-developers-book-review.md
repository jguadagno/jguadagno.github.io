![Software Architecture for Web Developers Book Cover](/assets/images/posts/book_review-software-architecture-for-web-developers-cover.jpg){: .align-left} This book is broken up into 3 parts. In the first part the author defines what software architecture is and what makes a *good* architecture. The second part, the author walks you through the types of Architects and the skill sets needed.  The author that wraps up the book with how a software engineer/developer can become an architect.

Like the definition of *Software Architecture*, which the author calls out, this book is a bit general. However, it is a good starting for someone that doesn't understand what the role is or does and either wants to become an architect or work with an architect.

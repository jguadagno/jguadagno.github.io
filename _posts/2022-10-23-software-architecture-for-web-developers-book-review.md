![Software Architecture for Web Developers Book Cover](/assets/images/posts/book_review-software-architecture-for-web-developers-cover.jpg){: .align-left} 
This book is broken up into three parts. 
In the first part, the author defines what software architecture is and what makes a good architecture. 
The second part, the author walks you through the types of Architects and the skill sets needed. 
The author wraps up the book with how a software engineer/developer can become an architect.

Like the definition of Software Architecture, which the author calls out, this book is a bit general. 
However,
it is a good start for someone that does not understand what the role is or does
and either wants to become an architect or work with an architect.

One thing that I have noticed of the past few years when it comes to conference or “Summits” is that there are a lot of after parties, tweets, etc. that happen.  Most of the time it is difficult to get the word out about these events or even find out about them.  That's where [MVPSummitEvents.com](http://www.mvpsummitevents.com){:target="_blank"} comes in.  The site will hopefully be a one-stop shop to find **public** events that are happening at the Microsoft 2010 MVP Global Summit.

From the site, you can add events, create venues, display events, subscribe to the RSS feed or iCal feed, download an event to outlook or calendar client that can consume a VCS file. **Note**: the creation of events and venues requires you to sign in using your Windows Live Id account, no information from Live is used within our site.

If the site is successful, I plan to white label it to use with other events like MIX2010, TechEd, PDC, etc.

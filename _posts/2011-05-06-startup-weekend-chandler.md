I wanted to let you know about an upcoming event called Startup Weekend Chandler. Startup Weekend is a non-profit, community-building event that brings together entrepreneurs of all backgrounds including software developers, marketers, designers, and other enthusiasts to start companies in just 54 hours. The participants that attend have 60 seconds to make a pitch (optional), the pitches are whittled down to the top ideas, and then teams form around the ideas to come out with several developed companies or projects. Finally, the weekend culminates with demonstrations in front of an audience of judges and potential investors.

This is Chandler's first Startup Weekend, but the event occurs all over the world throughout the year and they have been very successful. The event will be held the weekend of June 24th and more info is at [http://chandler.startupweekend.org](http://chandler.startupweekend.org/)

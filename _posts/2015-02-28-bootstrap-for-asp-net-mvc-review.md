Starts off with a good introduction to using Bootstrap in your ASP.NET applications. It covers the default "File \| New" experience, manually added files and my favorite, NuGet. The author then continues with introducing the Bootstrap element styles in a logical order, starting with the grid and ending with form validation.  Next the author introduces the JavaScript components of Bootstrap.

In the next part of the book the author does what I have not seen in other books on Bootstrap, the author explains how to create helper methods, which is good but there already is a well used package for that in which the author has a chapter on on at the end of the book.

The author goes on to give suggestions are to how to work with and convert sites that do not have bootstrap.

I’m not sure why but the author included a whole chapter using the jQuery DataTables plugin with some of it’s extensions with Bootstrap.

Overall, the book was easy to read, the author was clear and logical in his explanations of Bootstrap. I would recommend this book to someone just starting to learn Bootstrap and working on ASP.NET applications.

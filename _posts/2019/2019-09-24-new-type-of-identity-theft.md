Or at least new to me...

A few days ago, I got an email with the subject of *Inquiry* from a *Michael Fleming* at *michaeltfleming6@gmail.com*.  Initially, I didn't think anything of it.  This time of the year I get a lot of emails with random subjects because of [Desert Code Camp](https://www.desertcodecamp.com/home){:target="_blank"}. So I opened it and here is what it said.

This seems a bit odd especially for a "**internet recruiting quiz**". So I responded to the email with.

> Why would were I live pop up in a recruiting quiz?

"Mike" responded about 13 minutes later with...

> I apologize for bothering you.  If you can't tell me that's fine.  I know this seems super random, but the quiz grabs all kinds of random stuff from material/content published on the internet.

To me, this was even odder.  Although the response time made it seem real the response really didn't.

To which I responded...

> Honestly it sounds like you are attempting to steal my identity with a question like that.

"Mike" then responded 4 minutes later with...

> Yeah.  I kind of thought that after I sent the message.  I apologize.  Just disregard it all.  I do random stuff sometimes and realized, after the fact, that it probably wasn't appropriate.  Enjoy the rest of your evening.

That pretty much ended the conversation.  Maybe I am overly cautious or maybe this was honest.  I did move, I am in Technology but a lot of this stuff is publicly available.

Moral of the story, be careful of what you share and to whom you share it with.

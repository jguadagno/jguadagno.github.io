## Global Azure Boot Camp

Taking place on April 27th, in Chandler, AZ and all over the world, communities will come together once again in the seventh great Global Azure Boot Camp event! We are one of many user groups organizing our own one-day deep dive class on Azure the way it works best for our Phoenix members. The result is that thousands of people get to learn about Azure and join together online under the social hashtag #GlobalAzure!

As you start streaming more or recording videos for the future, there are few things you may want to consider to *tidy* things up.  Here are a few things you should consider.

## Branding

Building a brand is essential. Many speakers, presenters, and streamers have a brand. Scott Gu has his red polo shirt, and now dinosaur slippers. Ward Bell has ‘*crazy*’ outfits that he wears. Dan Wahlin wears a polo shirt in the shade of blue. I wear a polo shirt, with my company logo on in, and khakis. Keeping that consistent brand is key to people remembering. When they see you out of that element, they almost don’t recognize you :). The same goes for your stream, YouTube, and social media sites. The look, font, images, and colors should be consistent to tie your brand together. Please take a look at my [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/jguadagno){:target="_blank"} page and my [YouTube channel](https://jjg.me/youtube){:target="_blank"}.  The artwork is consistent across.  All of the newer videos are using the same images. Another great example is Brian Lagunas's, ([@brianlagunas](https://twitter.com/brianlagunas){:target="_blank"}) [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/brianlagunas){:target="_blank"} stream and his [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/brianlagunas){:target="_blank"} channel. These is consistency through-out his channels.

Now, you don't need to be a designer or have a designer.  There are many sites out there to help you.  You can quickly start with a theme.

## Themes

If you are using Streamlabs OBS or OBS itself, they support themes.  Themes are an excellent, semi-easy way to keep a consistent look across your stream, Twitch, and YouTube.  These sites provide some free and paid themes.

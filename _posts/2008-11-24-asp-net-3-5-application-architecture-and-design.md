Although the title of this book states the book is for ASP.NET 3.5 application architecture and design, you will be able to take these concepts well beyond ASP.NET.  The concepts and technics that this author conveys can be used for all Windows .NET development.  The author starts out explaining basic 1 tier architecture and eventually graduates you to a five-tier architecture.

The book covers ER diagrams, domain modeling, common design patterns, SOA, WCF, and even database design.  This book is a good starter book for those of you that want to move out of the developer role and start learning about basic principals in applications design.

There is only one downside the book and that is the formatting of the code samples.  There seems to be an issue with the spacing and tabs (at least in the book).  Other than that it is a good read.

You can purchase the book on the [PackT Publishing site](http://www.packtpub.com/application-architecture-and-design-for-asp-.net-3.5/book/mid/261108nprnz1){:target="_blank"}.

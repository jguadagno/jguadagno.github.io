Tomorrow, August 11th, 2023, I will kick off my Coding with JoeG stream again and I'll be joined by [Richard Dudley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAAYFTQB8y3h2jQK_51y7RmIo3PSopBQxDw?){:target="_blank"}. We'll start the stream at 1pm MST/PST, 4pm EST, 8pm UTC

Rich and I will work together to learn how to use [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/){:target="_blank"}. Here is the multi-day agenda:

## Local Development

* Demo the sample application
* Create a new repository for it
* Convert the application to use Containers
* Deploy to Kubernetes locally
* Figure out how to manage secrets
* Check stats of the cluster
* Look at Monitoring/Logging/Debugging

## Deploy to AWS

* Look at Cost
* Look at Deployment options
* Deploy to AWS
* Monitor

## Deploy to Azure

* Look at Cost
* Look at Deployment options
* Deploy to Azure

## Broadcasting on

* Twitch: <https://jjg.me/stream>{:target="_blank"}
* YouTube: <https://jjg.me/youtube>{:target="_blank"}
* Facebook: <https://facebook.com/josephguadagnonet>{:target="_blank"}

At the moment, my company page on [LinkedIn](https://lnkd.in/gTwNYV-e){:target="_blank"} does not have enough followers so I cannot broadcast there yet.

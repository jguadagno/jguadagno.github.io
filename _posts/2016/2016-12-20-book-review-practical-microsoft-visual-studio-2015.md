While the title of the book is "Practical Microsoft Visual Studio 2015", the author, Peter Ritchie, outlines how you can use Microsoft Visual Studio to effectively develop software and lead a team. Peter covers, a quick walkthrough of Microsoft Visual Studio, how to work with teams, version control, design and architecture, development, deployments, and testing. Anyone getting started with Microsoft Visual Studio or even experienced engineers, architects and leaders can find stuff in this that is useful for their day to day tasks. The best part of this book is the way the author explains each topic in a simple way based on his 20 or so ( :smile: ) years being in the software field.

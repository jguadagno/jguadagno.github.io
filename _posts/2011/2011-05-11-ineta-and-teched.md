Since being elected the President of [INETA](https://www.ineta.org){:target="_blank"} North America in April, I have heard some good and bad things about INETA from several people.  I want to make INETA better and more relevant for people and user groups. That being said, I will be at Microsoft [Tech·Ed](https://northamerica.msteched.com){:target="_blank"} in Atlanta next week along with the rest of the INETA board and would like to chat with people about the good, bad and ugly of INETA.  I will be

* At the INETA Community Leadership Summit on Sunday
* The INETA Booth in the Connect Zone on the Expo floor at 12:30 pm daily for the INETA raffle. 
* Community Night on Tuesday
* Walking throughout the convention center.

If you have some compliments, complains, suggestions or just want to chat, here's how you can get a hold of me:

* Come to the [INETA Community Leadership Summit](https://inetateched2011.eventbrite.com/){:target="_blank"} on Sunday.

* Hit me up on Twitter at [@jguadagno](https://twitter.com/jguadagno){:target="_blank"}.
* Look for me wearing my pink INETA shirt or my blue Polo shirt.
* Shoot me an email at [joseph.guadagno@ineta.org](mailto:joseph.guadagno@ineta.org){:target="_blank"} to set up a meeting.

BTW, [INETA](https://www.ineta.org){:target="_blank"} is doing a lot this year at Microsoft [Tech·Ed](https://northamerica.msteched.com){:target="_blank"}, check out the full list [here](https://blog.ineta.org/post/INETA-at-Teche280a2Ed-2011.aspx){:target="_blank"}.

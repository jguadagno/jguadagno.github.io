Back in January at [SoCal Code Camp](https://www.socalcodecamp.com/){:target="_blank"} Fullerton, [Daniel Egan](https://TheSociableGeek.com){:target="_blank"}, [Woody Pewitt](https://woodyp.info){:target="_blank"} and I were chatting about the different camps and how can we collaborate better. That's where the idea of the party bus can up.  We said, "What about getting a bus from LA to go to Chandler for Desert Code Camp?" If it was successful, we would do the same for the next [SoCal Code Camp](https://www.socalcodecamp.com/){:target="_blank"} in San Diego.

That being said, come and join the party bus from Los Angeles County to [Desert Code Camp](https://apr2011.desertcodecamp.com){:target="_blank"}. The tickets are $60 round trip. The location will be announced shortly, it will most likely be in Riverside or Ontario.  Drinks and snack will be provided on the bus. Reserve your seat [here](https://la2dcc2011.eventbrite.com){:target="_blank"}.

If you are worried about where you are going to stay, don't. The organizers of Desert Code Camp have partnered up with the [San Marcos Crowne Plaza](https://www.sanmarcosresort.com/){:target="_blank"} in downtown Chandler, AZ to bring you a  great hotel deal. Please visit the Desert Code Camp / San Marcos Crowne Plaza reservation [page](https://resweb.passkey.com/Resweb.do?mode=welcome_ei_new&eventID=3324014&utm_source=55438&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=4565629){:target="_blank"} to make your reservation.   Please note that the reservation for the hotel is separate from that of the bus ticket and you will be responsible for both.

I recently sat down with some other community evangelists in the Chandler / Phoenix area to talk about some of the events that I plan to put on in the coming year.

To get updates on these events, follow me on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com){:target="_blank"} [@jguadagno](https://www.twitter.com/jguadagno){:target="_blank"} and the Southeast Valley .NET User Group [@SEVDNUG](https://www.twitter.com/sevdnug){:target="_blank"} and continue to watch this blog.

Putting on an event is time-consuming, any help I receive is appreciated.  If you are interested let me know… Email me: [jguadagno@hotmail.com](mailto:jguadagno@hotmail.com)

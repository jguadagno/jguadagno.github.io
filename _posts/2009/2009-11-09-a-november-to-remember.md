And no it is not because the Yankees won the World Series (although congrats to them) it is because it has been an awesome month for me personally and professionally.

## On the personal front…

My son's baseball team, which I am an assistant coach, finished the season undefeated in regular season games (end of year tournament in next week).  My son hit his first over the fence home run which was a Grand Slam (technically not November but pretty awesome). My daughter's softball team, which I am an assistant coach, finished the season undefeated in regular season games (end of year tournament in next week).

I get to go fly back to NY in a few days to see family and friends and wish my mother a happy 60th birthday.

## On the professional front…

I was elected to the North American [INETA](https://www.ineta.org){:target="_blank"} board of directors.

I was elected to the [AZGiveCamp](https://www.azgivecamp.org){:target="_blank"} executive committee, VP of Operations.  As the VP I will oversee the activities of the Logistics, Sponsorship, Technology and Publicity teams.

I put together my first Code Camp, [Desert Code Camp](https://www.desertcodecamp.com/){:target="_blank"}.

I am presenting a [Bird of Feather](https://pdcbof.com){:target="_blank"} session at PDC with Chris Woodruff on “How to Build and Enrich Your Technical and Local Community” on Tuesday, Nov 17 from 11a – 12p.  Stop by if you want to see how to build your community.

That's it for now.  Hopefully, I can relax a bit in December.

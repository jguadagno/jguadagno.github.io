This month in a chat with the speakers of [ESPC](https://www.sharepointeurope.com/){:target="_blank"} one of the United States based speakers asked about some travel gear recommendations. I shared my travel gear with them and they found it helpful. I thought it would be a good idea to share it with you all. I have been using this gear for a while now and I am very happy with it. I hope you find it helpful too.

## Presentation Equipment

There are a few things that I always carry with me when I am presenting at a conference or a user group meeting. 

### Presentation Clicker

*Presentation Clicker Air Mouse Function Wireless Presenter USB Powerpoint Clicker (only USB Receiver) for Laptop, Computer, Projector, Mac, PC* ([Amazon Link](https://amzn.to/3DerKxb){:target="_blank"}). This device has more features than just advance and reverse slides. It has a built-in laser pointer, air mouse function, media play, and more. It is very handy when you are presenting and you need to move around the room.

### Extra Monitor

A lot of community conferences do not have "confidence monitors" for the speakers. I always carry a portable monitor with me. It is very handy when you are presenting and you need to see your slides. I use the *Lepow Portable Monitor, 15.6 Inch Full HD 1080P USB Type-C Computer Display* ([Amazon Link](https://amzn.to/41AnRwP){:target="_blank"}). It's lightweight and easy to carry. Plus I can use it as a second monitor when I am working from hotels.

Having a second monitor requires having an adapter to connect it to your laptop. The are two different cables to use with this monitor depending on the version you have.  I have an older version that supports USB-C and mini HDMI. For this, I have this cable: *Cable Matters High-Speed 4K Mini HDMI to HDMI Cable 15ft* ([Amazon Link](https://amzn.to/3ZvrnFO){:target="_blank"}). If you are purchasing the model linked above, you will need a USB-C to USB-C cable. I recommend the *JSAUX 100W USB C to USB C Cable* ([Amazon Link](https://amzn.to/3DkujxN){:target="_blank"}). I keep a couple of these cables in my bag for data transfer and charging.

### Presentation Adapters

I never know what type of equipment I am going to be presenting on so I carry along a few different video "adapters" to accommodate different types of projectors. I use the USB C to HDMI Adapter, *Tuwejia USB 3.1 Type C Thunderbolt 3 to HDMI 4K Adapter Compatible with MacBook Pro 2018/2017, MacBook Air, Samsung Galaxy S10 S9 S8 Note 9, Surface Book 2 and More* ([Amazon Link](https://amzn.to/4glrEmg){:target="_blank"}).

I also carry in my bag the *Anker 332 USB-C Hub (5-in-1) with 4K HDMI Display, 5Gbps - and 2 5Gbps USB-A Data Ports* ([Amazon Link](https://amzn.to/41TUaaf){:target="_blank"}). This is a great adapter to have in your bag. It has a USB-C port, 2 USB-A ports, and an HDMI port. It is very handy when you need to connect multiple devices to your laptop or even power your USC-C laptop.

#### Presentation Cables

I always have a few different cables in bag:

* [Amazon Basics High-Speed 4k Ultra HD HDMI 2.0 Cable](https://amzn.to/49Cf9zS){:target="_blank"}
* [JSAUX 100W USB C to USB C Cable](https://amzn.to/3DkujxN){:target="_blank"}

### Cable Bag

This item took me a while to find the "right" one. I wanted something that was small enough to fit in my backpack but big enough to hold all of my cables. I found the *BUBM Double Layer Electronic Accessories Organizer, Travel Gadget Bag for Cables, USB Flash Drive, Plug and More* ([Amazon Link](https://amzn.to/4iFPkmD){:target="_blank"}). It is perfect for my needs. It has a lot of pockets and compartments to hold all of my cables and adapters.

## Travel Equipment

For travel, I have a few different items that I always carry with me. Here is a list of the equipment that I carry with me.

I need something to carry all of my equipment in. I use the *TUMI - Alpha Bravo Search Backpack - Laptop Backpack for Men & Women - Backpack for Work & Travel - 17.0" X 14.0" X 8.3" - Navy Blue* ([Amazon Link](https://amzn.to/3P0ia3H){:target="_blank"}), which my wife purchased for me for Christmas a few years ago. It is very handy when you are traveling. It has a lot of pockets and compartments to hold all of my equipment. It is very handy when you are traveling and you need to carry all of your equipment.

This charger is very handy when you are traveling.

This charger is very handy when you are traveling for the night time.

It has 3 charging pads, one for your phone, one for your watch, and one for your earbuds. I set it up in my hotel room when I get there to charge my phone, watch, and ear buds.

Since public speaking generally requires travel and you can not guarantee the quality of the power outlets on airplanes, trains, or at the venue, I always carry a portable charger with me. I use the *25800mAh Power Bank, 22.5w Fast Charging Battery Pack* ([Amazon Link](https://amzn.to/49HvRhC){:target="_blank"}). This charger is very handy when you are traveling.

Recently, I added trackers to all of my bags, including my laptop bag.  Since I have an Android based phone, I added the *Pebblebee Tracker Clip Universal - Rechargable Item Tracker* ([Amazon Link](https://amzn.to/3ZVfNVW){:target="_blank"}). This product works both with Android and iOS devices. It came in very handy on the return flight from Stockholm when my bags decided to extend their vacation and not come home with me. :smile: Pebblebee also has a card version of the tracker that I have in my wallet and large suitcases. The *Pebblebee Tracker Card Universal - Rechargeable Slim Item Tracker* ([Amazon Link](https://amzn.to/4gdMDHm){:target="_blank"}).

## International Travel Equipment

For international travel, I have a few different items that I always carry with me. Here is a list of the equipment that I carry with me.

It also has a built-in power converter so you can use it in different countries. In addition, it supports fast charging, so you can charge your devices quickly.

I primarily use a Dell laptop and it's AC adapter has a "[mickey mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_60320){:target="_blank"}" style plug, or more technically known as an IEC 60320 C5 connector, to power the power brick. This makes it easy to find a replacement power cord when traveling internationally.

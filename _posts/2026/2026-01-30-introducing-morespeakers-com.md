For the last two months I've been working on an exciting new project called [MoreSpeakers.com](https://morespeakers.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. This platform is dedicated to bridging the gap between aspiring and experienced speakers in the technology community by creating meaningful mentorship relationships that foster growth, confidence, and knowledge sharing.  The project is a collaboration between myself, [Chris Woodruff](https://www.woodruff.dev/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [Peter Ritchie](https://blog.peterritchie.com/about){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and [Jorge Cura](https://github.com/curajorge){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. The idea was born, like most great ideas, from a conference conversation between Chris Woodruff and Scott Hunter during a *TibiTab*, if you know you know :smile:, about the challenges of getting started in public speaking.

Chris started by building a working prototype using Claude Code to see what it can do. After seeing the potential, I joined the project to help turn the prototype into a full-fledged platform. Over the next two months, we worked to design, develop, and launch MoreSpeakers.com.

## Key Features

The platform's main goal is to connect aspiring speakers with experienced mentors who can guide them through the process of becoming confident public speakers. Once a user signs up, they can create a profile highlighting their speaking interests (expertise's) and goals. They can then browse through a list of available mentors, read their profiles, and request mentorship. Experienced speakers can also sign up to become mentors, sharing their knowledge and helping others grow.

### How It Works

First step is to **Sign Up**. Users can create an account on [MoreSpeakers.com](https://morespeakers.com/Register){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, providing basic information about themselves and their speaking interests.  After signing up, you can browse through the list of available mentors. Each mentor has a profile that includes their areas of expertise, speaking experience, and availability. When you find a mentor that aligns with your interests and goals, you can send them a mentorship request. Once a mentor accepts your request, you can start scheduling sessions and working together to improve your speaking skills.

Next step is to navigate to the **Browse Speakers** [page](https://morespeakers.com/speakers){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. Here, you can filter speakers based on various criteria such as expertise, availability, and location. This makes it easy to find mentors who match your specific needs.

Once you've found a mentor that interests you, click on their profile to learn more about their background, experience, and areas of expertise. This information will help you determine if they are the right fit for your mentorship needs.

In the search results, you can see a list of speakers that match your criteria. Each entry includes the speaker's name, areas of expertise, and a brief bio. You can click on a speaker's name to view their full profile.

The speaker profile provides detailed information about the speaker, including their biography, goals and objectives, areas of expertise's, links to their social media profiles, their [Sessionize](https://sessionize.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} profile (if they provided one), and more. This information will help you decide if this mentor is the right fit for you.

If the speaker looks like a good match, you can send them a **Mentorship Request** directly from their profile page by clicking on *Request Mentorship*.

#### Sending a Mentorship Request

After finding a mentor, you can send them a **Mentorship Request**.

![MoreSpeakers.com Mentorship Request](/assets/images/posts/2026/introducing-morespeakers-com/mentorship-request.png){: .align-center}

This request includes the expertise's you are interested in and a brief message explaining why you are interested in working with them and what you hope to achieve through the mentorship. Once the mentor accepts your request, you can start scheduling sessions and working together to improve your speaking skills.

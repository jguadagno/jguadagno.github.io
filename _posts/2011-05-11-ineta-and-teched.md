Since being elected the President of [INETA](http://www.ineta.org) North America in April, I have heard some good and bad things about INETA from several people.  I want to make INETA better and more relevant for people and user groups. That being said, I will be at Microsoft [Tech·Ed](http://northamerica.msteched.com) in Atlanta next week along with the rest of the INETA board and would like to chat with people about the good, bad and ugly of INETA.  I will be

* At the INETA Community Leadership Summit on Sunday
* The INETA Booth in the Connect Zone on the Expo floor at 12:30 pm daily for the INETA raffle. 
* Community Night on Tuesday
* Walking throughout the convention center.

If you have some compliments, complains, suggestions or just want to chat, here’s how you can get a hold of me:

* Come to the [INETA Community Leadership Summit](http://inetateched2011.eventbrite.com/) on Sunday.
* My TechEd [contact card](http://northamerica.msteched.com/Directory/Details/a6434085-9918-4201-849e-8e6b2ad89337?fbid=R0PcL7ZnU9F), contact me there or setup a meeting using that sites tool.
* Hit me up on Twitter at [@jguadagno](http://twitter.com/jguadagno).
* Look for me wearing my pink INETA shirt or my blue Polo shirt.
* Shoot me an email at [joseph.guadagno@ineta.org](mailto:joseph.guadagno@ineta.org) to set up a meeting.

BTW, [INETA](http://www.ineta.org) is doing a lot this year at Microsoft [Tech·Ed](http://northamerica.msteched.com), check out the full list [here](http://blog.ineta.org/post/INETA-at-Teche280a2Ed-2011.aspx).

I look forward to chatting with you.

I typically post reviews of books based on technology topics like .NET, LINQ, etc. but I thought this book would be a could fit for the site.  This book is about creating effective PowerPoint slides which many technology professionals, like myself, do on a regular basis. On to the review...

The author breaks up the book into multiple chapters but not your typically kind of chapters.  These chapters are about the different parts that make up a slide; graphics, displaying data, diagrams, use of movement, etc.  Each chapter is typically closed with a Case Study which demonstrates the use of the technic or recommends. This is done by showing a before and after the presentation.  The author also reinforces her points effectively by using graphics, colors, and illustrations.

The book is chock full of handy tips and suggestions that anyone can use to create dazzling and effective PowerPoint slides.  If you present using PowerPoint, this is a must-have.

My first Code Camp is done and I wanted to jot down some of the lessons I learned.

## Bring EXTRA equipment!

You will never now what people will want or need. Here’s a list of items that are good to have.

* Adapters
  * DVI to VGA (those MACs)
  * HDMI to VGA
  * Multiple video to VGA
* Mice
* CAT5 cables
* USB Cables
* USB Flash drive

## Speakers

* Speakers will cancel.  It is an unfortunate fact.
* Don’t allow one speaker to speak at more than 3 sessions.  This reduces your risk in case of cancellation and prevents speaker fatigue.

## Schedule

Printed schedules are good to have and good to hang.  Also add speaker names to the presentations.

## Name Tags

People like and want them.

## Venue

* WIFI is key.  A reliable and unobtrusive WiFi connection is best.
* You need to be able handle last minute room changes

## Food

* Make sure you provide the person(s) that are ordering the food explicit instructions on the food.
* Try to have more than just pizza.
* You should have vegetarian and vegan options.

And remember **you are not going to be able to make _EVERYONE_ happy.**

When I first learned about this book I could not wait to get my hands on it for two reasons.  One, my current work project involves designing an API for an application to “talk” to a wide variety of systems. The second is one of the authors, [Glenn Block](http://codebetter.com/glennblock/). I’ve known Glenn for a while. I’ve seen him present, I’ve talked with him, read his blog posts and knew the book would not disappoint and it did not.

The book starts off with covering the [HTTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP) protocol, then moves into the different types of API styles like the [Richardson Maturity Model,](http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html) [RPC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call), [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) and others. The authors do this to give the readers an understanding of how the web works and why the [Web API](http://www.asp.net/web-api) framework in ASP.NET is the way it is. The authors describe, in depth, building out an API, versioning it, applying security, formatting responses and talk about testability of an API.

In short, this book is a must have for anyone working on or designing any API.

**Disclaimer** I was given a copy of this book in the hopes that I would review it. I only post reviews on books that I think would provide some benefit to the development community.

## Why I'm Running

For 20 years or so I have been in Software Development. During that time I have used many tools, languages, and technologies. I started out programming with a small book on QuickBASIC. I later moved on to Visual Basic for DOS. Windows then came along and I starting using Visual Basic for Windows, I then migrated to Visual Basic .NET and eventually ended up using Visual C#. I work as an Engineering Director at Rocket Mortgage, based in Detroit, MI. I am a public speaker and present internationally on a lot of different [technology topics](http://www.josephguadagno.net/presentations/){:target="_blank"}.

One of my primary goals in life is to *leave this live (planet) better than it was when I joined it*. I do that in many ways. My favorite way is to grow people and help make them better. I do this through education. Presenting/Public Speaking.  I also do this by helping others find ways to help themselves grow.  I believe that being on the board of the .NET Foundation, I can help the vision of .NET and make it easier for others to adopt and grow themselves.  In the past, I have worked with many other talented professionals while serving on the Board of Directors for [INETA](#ineta-experience){:target="_blank"} to help spread the education and adoption of .NET.

I feel I am very well suited for the position.

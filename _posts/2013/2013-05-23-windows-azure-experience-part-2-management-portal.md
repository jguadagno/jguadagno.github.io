This Part 2 of a [series of posts]({% link _posts/2013/2013-05-21-the-windows-azure-experience.md %}) about my “upgrade” to Windows Azure. Next up in this series is the Windows Azure Management Portal.  It can be accessed directly at [https://manage.windowsazure.com/](https://manage.windowsazure.com/ "https://manage.windowsazure.com/"){:target="_blank"} or by visiting [https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/](https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/){:target="_blank"} and clicking on the portal link in the upper hand corner.

***Note:*** There are two different sign is screens available, one for those the use a Microsoft Account for Office 365 and one that use a “regular” Windows Live account like hotmail.com or msn.com.

## Navigation

The “home page” for the portal is broken up into 4 parts: [![image](/assets/images/posts/image_thumb_9.png "image")](/assets/images/posts/image_10.png)  

### Part 1 - Navigation Bar

The navigation bar allows you to view documentation, pricing, downloads, community and support. You can also change the language and access your account.

### Part 2 – “Table of Contents”

This lets you access off of the Windows Azure Services that you have.  There will be a number beneath each services which indicates what have many “items” you have activated with that service.  In my example, I have 1 Web Site and 2 SQL Databases.  You can click on any of these to access the service.

### Part 3 – Main Body

This is where the settings or actions of the service items live.  In the example above, you see all items which lists all of the services I have and their current status. For the “All Items” selection you get a list of all the services that you have a subscription and their statuses.  Windows Azure allows you to have multiple subscriptions linked to one account, that is why the subscription column is present.

### Part 4 – App Bar

The app bar is synonymous with the  Windows 8 app bar, it provides actions that you can take based on what service you are in and what item is selected. In the example above I have a web site selected so I am presented with the ability to:

* Create a new Web Site
* Browse the Site
* Stop the Site
* Restart the Site
* Manage Domains
* Delete the Site
* Install Web Matrix
* View (context sensitive) Help

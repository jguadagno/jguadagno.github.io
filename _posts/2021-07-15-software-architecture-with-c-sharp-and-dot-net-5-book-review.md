The book's title should be Software Architecture with Azure, C# 9, and .NET since the book focuses on the Microsoft stack and development tools.

The book starts with getting an understanding of what software architecture is.

* Including software development processes
* The role of software architects
* Non Functional Requirements (NFRs).

After introducing architecture, the author gets into designing and building software using Microsoft tools and services. Including how you can use Azure DevOps to document requirements, figuring out which Azure services to use to host and develop your application.

From there, you build an application from scratch, introducing architecture, design concepts, and other things to consider along the way. Finally, the last few chapters cover unit testing and functional testings, and building a CI/CD pipeline.

At the end of the book, you would have been exposed to ways to build highly scalable applications using Microsoft development tools and Microsoft Azure.

Overall, the other covers a lot of topics but scratches the surface with some of them.

On a side note, I like the Questions and Further Readings section that this book has.  It's an excellent way to test if you picked up what the author wrote in the chapter. So add that with the Further Readings section to help the author drive home the point and provide the reader with additional reference materials.

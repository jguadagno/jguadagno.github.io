This book is built on the beta of version 3.5 of the .NET framework. Since LINQ is a subset of the language enhancements made to .NET 3.5, the author chose to cover some of them also like Local Type Inference, kinda cool but I think it will lead to sloppy code. Overall I would say go out and get the book since .NET 3.5 is here. Topics Include:

* LINQ Introduction
* C# Language Features
* Visual Basic 9 Language Features
* LINQ Syntax Fundamentals
* LINQ to SQL
* LINQ to XML
* ADO.NET Entity Framework

As some of you know, I have the [Southeast Valley .NET User Group](http://www.sevdnug.org/) web site running on [Telerik's](http://www.telerik.com/) [Sitefinity](http://www.sitefinity.com/) product.  The product itself is awesome but needs a few features here an there... One of which is a mechanism to get data into Sitefinity quickly. Luckily, Sitefinity provides a pretty extensive [API](http://www.sitefinity.com/help/developer-manual) for you to develop against. So with some free time, the little I have, I put together a Data Importer tool for Sitefinity. This tool will allow you to import data from a Comma Separated file into any Sitefinity generic provider.

The project is open source and available at [http://www.codeplex.com/SEVDNUGDataImporter](http://www.codeplex.com/SEVDNUGDataImporter "http://www.codeplex.com/SEVDNUGDataImporter") please report any problems or feature request there.

Enjoy!

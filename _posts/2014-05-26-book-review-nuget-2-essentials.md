A few months ago I was asked to be a Technical Reviewer for a new NuGet book coming out.  I happily said yes and a month or two later out came [NuGet 2 Essentials](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/178216586X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=178216586X&linkCode=as2&tag=beyondthebasic0e&linkId=IK4FKY7RGOQT7LZU){:target="_blank"}.

The book starts off with the typical “*Hello World*” or in it's case, the getting started with NuGet.  The authors do a good job of explaining what NuGet is, how to install it and how to use it to manage packages. They then go into great detail on the anatomy of a NuGet package, how to create, how to version, how to publish and how to add features to a package after it is deployed.  The final chapter is all about setting up your own NuGet server in your environment and how you can integrate NuGet into your continuous build process.

Overall, it is a good and quick read.  I find it a nice hand reference for when I am working on NuGet packages.

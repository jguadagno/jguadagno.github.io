When I first got this book I thought it was going to be a compilation of tips and tricks. I was quite surprised with the fact that it really wasn't.Â  The author starts out by telling you how you to determine the bottlenecks in your site then goes into a lot of samples on how to correct and / or improve them. He covers memory, CPU, caching, compression and more.  

This book is definitely worth a read then a reread every once in a while. I plan on implementing some of the suggestions for my sites.

Check out the book on the [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com/asp-net-site-performance-secrets/book){:target="_blank"} site or [ASP.NET Site Performance Secrets](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1849690685/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=beyondthebasic0e&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1849690685){:target="_blank"}.

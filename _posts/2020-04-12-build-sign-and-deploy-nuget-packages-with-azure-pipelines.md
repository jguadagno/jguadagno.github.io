In this post we'll cover how you can use Azure Pipelines to build, test, sign, and deploy a NuGet package written with .NET Core.

## Intro to Yaml

Before we get started, you might want to brush up on [YAML](https://yaml.org/). If you do not know what YAML is, it is a human-friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages. I like to think of it as a more modern, less verbose version of XML. If YAML or learning another language/data format scares you, do be worried!  You don't need to read/write YAML in order to use Azure Pipelines. Azure provides a UI to build out your pipeline.  That's how I learned it!

If you understand YAML, check out the [Azure YAML schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/yaml-schema?view=azure-devops&tabs=schema%2Cparameter-schema&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-4024623).

## Getting Started

Sign into the Azure DevOps portal, click on *Pipelines* then *Pipelines* or visit *username*.visualstudio.com/*Public*/_build. Be sure to replace your *username* with yours or your organizations and *Public* with whatever project name want to work with created.

If you don't have any pipelines created, you'll see this.

![Build and Sign - Create Pipeline](/assets/images/posts/build-sign-create-pipeline.png){: .align-center}

Click 'Create Pipeline' to start the Pipeline Wizard.

![Build and Sign - Create Pipeline Wizard - Connect](/assets/images/posts/build-sign-pipeline-connect.png){: .align-center}

Choose the repository where your source code is. I used 'Azure Repos Git'

Select the repository. I chose my 'AwesomeSample' repository

![Build and Sign - Create Pipeline Wizard - Select](/assets/images/posts/build-sign-pipeline-select.png){: .align-center}

Now choice your pipeline.

![Build and Sign - Create Pipeline Wizard - Configure](/assets/images/posts/build-sign-pipeline-configure.png){: .align-center}

If you chose, 'Show more', you will get some templates for common projects like .NET applications, web applications, Android applications, and more.

Click 'Starter pipeline' since we are going to build it from scratch.  This will bring use to the pipeline editor to review it.

![Build and Sign - Create Pipeline Wizard - Review](/assets/images/posts/build-sign-pipeline-review.png){: .align-center}

### Pipeline Editor

While you are good to go at this point, once you click 'Save and run', let's go through the editor. You'll notice that is has a familiar feel if you have done and Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code development.  In fact, this editor has Intellisense built-in also.

The components of the editor:

![Build and Sign - Create Pipeline Wizard - Annotated Editor](/assets/images/posts/build-sign-pipeline-review-annotated.png){: .align-center}

**1** - Repository Name

**2** - Pipeline file name.  You can click here to rename the default pipeline name.  From what I can tell, most people keep the default.

**3** - Variable.  This provides access to variables to use through out your pipeline. We may cover this later.

**4** - Save and run.  This is how you can save and 'execute' or 'run' your pipeline. If you click on the dropdown icon, you can just save the file without running it.

**5** - Show assistant.  This provides a mini wizard to chose tasks and settings.

**6** - The editor.  This is the file editor. Line numbers, Intellisense, and more!

## Pipeline Basics

Check the docs, [Key Concepts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/key-pipelines-concepts?view=azure-devops&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-4024623) for some key concepts on everything that makes up a pipeline.  We are going to cover [triggers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/key-pipelines-concepts?view=azure-devops&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-4024623#trigger), [pools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/agents?view=azure-devops&tabs=browser&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-4024623), variables, [steps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/key-pipelines-concepts?view=azure-devops&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-4024623#step), and [tasks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/key-pipelines-concepts?view=azure-devops&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-4024623#task).

### Trigger

The trigger of a pipeline is probably exactly what you are thinking it is.  This is what will kick off or trigger the script automatically.  You can still kick off a script from this page or the pipeline page.

For our script, and simplicity's sake, we are going to have the script kick off on any commits to the *master* branch.

```yaml
trigger:
- master
```

### Setup Pool

The pool tells Azure when VMs and 'pooled' resources it should use.  This varies based on the subscription model you have and are willing to pay for. For a list of the built-in agents, see the document called '[Microsoft-hosted agents](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/hosted?view=azure-devops&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-4024623)'.

Since we are planning to sign the package and the signing only works on Windows machines (at least that I could get to work). We are going to choose a vmImage of `windows-latest`.

```yaml
pool:
  vmImage: 'windows-latest'
```

### Steps

Now you can think of the steps as the individual tasks that needs to happen.  In fact, you will be creating *tasks* for each thing we want to do.

```yaml
steps:
```

### .NET version

Now let's tell the agent what version of .NET to run

```yaml
- task: UseDotNet@2
  displayName: Setup .NET SDK Version 3.x
  inputs:
    packageType: sdk
    version: 3.x
    includePreviewVersions: true
```

The `- task:` should be on the next line after the `steps:` element. The value after the `task` is the task name.  In this case, we are running the task call *UseDotNet* and version *2*.  The convention for the task name is `taskName@versionNumber`. Don't worry, you don't have to remember them all.  You use the assistant to generate the snippet. the *displayName* can be whatever text you want it to be. This will be shown in the pipeline progress/status page.

`inputs` vary by tasks.  In the case, we are using `packageType`, `version`, and `includePreviewVersions`.

### Build project

In order to run the unit tests and ultimately sign the package we need to build the project. Let's create a 'Build' task with the following YAML.

```yaml
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  displayName: 'Build the Assembly'
  inputs:
    command: build
    versioningScheme: byBuildNumber
    arguments: '--configuration $(BuildConfiguration)'
```

You'll notice after we paste or type in the code in the editor a *Settings* item appeared.  You can click on this to get the assistant to open for that task.  It looks something like this.

![Build and Sign - Task Assistant](/assets/images/posts/build-sign-assistant.png){: .align-center}

The 'Assistant' provides a GUI for editing specifics of a task.  In most cases you can click on '*About this task*' for the task documentation.

I bet you are wondering the `$(BuildConfiguration)` value is for the *arguments* property is?  These tasks will build the project, as the *command* input property suggests with the *versioningScheme* of `byBuildNumber`. To me, this was one of the hardest pieces to automate so I had proper [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for the package. For this to work 'correctly' and automatically we needed to make some changes to the project file.  I added two project groups to my projects .csproj file.

#### Assembly Versioning

```xml
  <PropertyGroup>
    <VersionMajor>1</VersionMajor>
    <VersionMinor>0</VersionMinor>
    <VersionBuild>0</VersionBuild>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <PropertyGroup>
    <VersionPrefix Condition=" '$(BUILD_BUILDNUMBER)' == '' ">$(VersionMajor).$(VersionMinor).$(VersionBuild)-local</VersionPrefix>
    <VersionPrefix Condition=" '$(BUILD_BUILDNUMBER)' != '' And '$(Configuration)' == 'Debug'" >$(VersionMajor).$(VersionMinor).$(VersionBuild)-$(BUILD_BUILDNUMBER)-preview</VersionPrefix>
    <VersionPrefix Condition=" '$(Configuration)' != 'Debug'">$(VersionMajor).$(VersionMinor).$(VersionBuild)</VersionPrefix>
  </PropertyGroup>
```

The first group is contains the versioning info.  Now, the engineer is responsible for versioning the project.  **Note**: The version number will be used for the Assembly, the NuGet package name, and NuGet versioning information.

The second group, defines how the version number is generated. These version numbers are based on where and how the application is being built.  

| Version Prefix | Condition | Assembly Info | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| First | `'$(BUILD_BUILDNUMBER)' == ''` | $(VersionMajor).$(VersionMinor).$(VersionBuild)-local | `BUILD_BUILDNUMBER` is only populated on the Azure build agents so it is empty when you build locally |
| Second | `'$(BUILD_BUILDNUMBER)' != '' And '$(Configuration)' == 'Debug'"` | $(VersionMajor).$(VersionMinor).$(VersionBuild)-$(BUILD_BUILDNUMBER)-preview | This means we are building the Assembly in Azure and choosing the `Debug` configuration |
| Third | `'$(Configuration)' != 'Debug'"` | $(VersionMajor).$(VersionMinor).$(VersionBuild) | This means we are building in a `Release` configuration |

#### Pipeline Parameter and Variables

Because we want the ability to indicate whether we are building the `Debug` or `Release` configuration, we are going to use '[parameters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/runtime-parameters?view=azure-devops&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-4024623)' and '[variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/variables?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml%2Cbatch&WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-4024623)'

Let's go back to before the `trigger`, around line 5 or 6 and past this parameter yaml.

```yaml
parameters:
  - name: buildConfig
    displayName: Build Configuration to Use
    default: Debug
    values:
    - Debug
    - Release
```

This creates a parameter in the pipeline call **buildConfig**.  **buildConfig** will be displayed with the text of *Build Configuration to Use*. The **buildConfig** parameter will only have two choices of `Debug` and `Release` and will be presented as a dropdown list.  We set the default selection to `Debug`. Having a default is important if you are running the pipeline on any trigger.  Setting the default for the build configuration to `Debug` ensures that I do not commit `Release` builds unintentionally.

**NOTE**: The need to a **buildConfig** is not needed if you want to control the build configuration by branches.  That is a little beyond this post.

Now, that we have the parameter, we need to create a variable to place the selected configuration into.

Below the `pool` and before the `steps`, around line 19, insert this YAML to create the variable.

{% raw %}
```yaml
variables:
  buildConfiguration: ${{ parameters.buildConfig }}
```
{% endraw %}

This now creates the variable **buildConfigurations** based on the **buildConfig** parameter

### Test the project

We'll want to make sure that all of unit tests for our project pass before we attempt to sign the package.  Jump back down to the end of the file, around line 37, and enter the test task

```yaml
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  displayName: 'Run the Unit Tests'
  inputs:
    command: 'test'
```

### Package the Project

Now that the project has been built and the unit tests pass, let's package the project.

```yaml
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  displayName: Package up the Assembly
  inputs:
    command: 'pack'
    packagesToPack: './src/*.csproj'
    nobuild: true
    verbosityPack: 'Normal'
```

The **nobuild** tells *dotnet* to not build the project. Building the project is not necessary since it was built so that we can run the unit tests.

### Sign the Package

Phew, the project is packaged, let's sign it.

We are going to use [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/key-vault/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-4024623) to use our certificate to sign the package. If you haven't setup a certificate in a key vault yet, check out [Setup Code Signing Certificates in Azure Key Vault]({% post_url 2020-04-04-setup-code-signing-certificates-in-azure-key-vault %})

To assist us in using Azure Key Vault certificate signing, we are going to use a community created tool, [NuGetKeyVaultSignTool](https://github.com/novotnyllc/NuGetKeyVaultSignTool).  This tool uses some of the Key Vault APIs.  As a result, we are going to need *client id* and *client secret*. For more on setting up an application in Azure to access the Key Vault through an API check out [Setup an Azure Application with Permissions to Enable Certificate Signing]({% post_url 2020-04-07-setup-an-azure-application-with-permissions-to-enable-certificate-signing %}).  

We are going to need the *client id*, *client secret*, and a few other values for our building and signing of the package. Since you ***NEVER EVER*** want to store any secrets in your source code repository, we are going to need an alternate way to access those secrets and keep them out of our source code repository.  Azure Pipelines offers Variable for that.  So let's create some.

#### Setup the Variables

You'll probably want to open another tab for this step. In the new tab, navigate to the Azure DevOps portal, click on *Pipelines*, then *Library* or visit *username*.visualstudio.com/*Public*/_library?itemType=VariableGroups. Be sure to replace your *username* with yours or your organizations and *Public* with whatever project name you created.

You should see a variable *New variable group* screen.

![Build and Sign - Creating a Variable Group](/assets/images/posts/build-sign-variable-groups.png){: .align-center}

* Click on '+ Variable Group'
* Enter the following

| Property | Value | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Variable Group Name | `CodeSigning` | |
| Description | `This is the group for handling all of the secrets for signing the code` | |
| Allow access to all pipelines | `Selected` | I chose `Yes`, you choose what is correct for your environment |
| Link secrets from an Azure key vault as variables | `Selected` | This is optional, I chose to do it so only Key Vault admins can see the secrets |
| Azure subscription | *your azure subscription* | Optional, if you chose to link secrets.  You will have to authorize the secrets if you haven't already |
| Key Vault Name | *your vault* | Optional, if you chose to link secrets.  You will have to authorize the secrets if you haven't already |

Once the 'Link secrets from an Azure Key Vault as variables' is complete and you click '+ Add' under variables, you will be presented with a dialog to 'Choose secrets', similar to this one.

![Build and Sign - Adding a linked variable](/assets/images/posts/build-sign-variable-add.png){: .align-center}

I added the client id and secrets to my vault already, so I selected them and clicked ok.

Now click, Save.

#### Sign Package

Back to the pipeline editor tab.

We'll first need to add the new created *client id* and *client secret* variables as a variable in the pipeline.  Go back to the **variables** section of our pipeline and add `- group: CodeSigning` to the section. Because we added a group the original variable **buildConfiguration** needs to be changed to a *name* *value* format. Once done it should look like this.

```yaml
variables:
- name: buildConfiguration
  value: ${{ parameters.buildConfig }}
- group: CodeSigning
```

Since we are accessing the library now, this pipeline is going to need extra permissions.

![Build and Sign - Pipeline needs permissions](/assets/images/posts/build-sign-pipeline-needs-permission.png){: .align-center}

* Click 'View'
* Click 'Permit'

You'll be prompted to confirm the permission.

![Build and Sign - Pipeline Confirm Permissions](/assets/images/posts/build-sign-pipeline-needs-permission-confirm.png){: .align-center}

* Click 'Permit'

By granting permission, a new hidden task happens to download the certificates.  In my case, I get a 'Download secrets: PersonalSecrets'.

We first need to install the [NuGetKeyVaultSignTool](https://github.com/novotnyllc/NuGetKeyVaultSignTool), so let's create a task for it.

```yaml
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  displayName: Install NuGetKeyVaultSignTool
  inputs:
    command: 'custom'
    custom: 'tool'
    arguments: 'install --tool-path . NuGetKeyVaultSignTool'
```

Here we created used the custom option for the DotNetCoreCli task to install the tool.

Now we'll need to create a script to call the tool

```yaml
- task: PowerShell@2
  displayName: Running NuGetKeyVaultSign
  inputs:
    targetType: 'inline'
    script: |
      .\NuGetKeyVaultSignTool sign ./src/**/*.nupkg `
      --file-digest "sha256" `
      --timestamp-rfc3161 "http://timestamp.digicert.com" `
      --timestamp-digest "sha256" `
      --azure-key-vault-url "https://<yourvaultname>.vault.azure.net/" `
      --azure-key-vault-tenant-id "92a85e53-affe-4d2d-ac5d-99383f88e2e3" `
      --azure-key-vault-client-id "$(azure-key-vault-client-id)" `
      --azure-key-vault-client-secret "$(azure-key-vault-client-secret)" `
      --azure-key-vault-certificate "<certificateName>"
```

**NOTE** There a backticks "\`" at the end of every line.  This is used so the Powershell tasks knows that we are continuing on the next line.

The first part of the Powershell shell task is the execute the `NuGetKeyVaultSignTool` with the `sign` option. The `./src/**/*.nupkg` argument will get us the built package. The rest of the arguments go into what the tool needs to sign the package suing Azure Key Vault.

| Argument | Value | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **file-digest** | `sha256` |  This shouldn't need to change depending on your certificate |
| **timestamp-rfc3161** | `http://timestamp.digicert.com` | This shouldn't need to change unless you get your certificate from another source |
| **timestamp-digest** | `sha256` | This shouldn't need to change depending on your certificate |
| **azure-key-vault-url** | `https://<yourvaultname>.vault.azure.net/` | Replace this vault with the Url for your Azure Key Vault |
| **azure-key-vault-tenant-id** | `92a85e53-affe-4d2d-ac5d-99383f88e2e3` | Replace this with the Azure Tenant Id that this Key Vault is in |
| **azure-key-vault-client-id** | `$(azure-key-vault-client-id)` | Pulls the value from the CodeSigning group and Azure Key Vault |
| **azure-key-vault-client-secret** | `$(azure-key-vault-client-secret)` | Pulls the value from the CodeSigning group and Azure Key Vault |
| **azure-key-vault-certificate** | `<certificateName>`| Replace with the name of your certificate |

### Azure Artifact

If you haven't setup up an Azure Artifact repository you can ready the post [Setup Azure Artifacts to Host Your NuGet Packages]({% post_url 2020-04-04-setup-azure-artifacts-to-host-nuget-packages %}) to get started.

The last step is publishing or 'pushing' the package off to Azure Artifacts. For this, we are going to continue to use the DotNetCli task with the *push* command.

```yaml
- task: DotNetCoreCLI@2
  displayName: 'Publish the NuGet Package'
  inputs:
    command: 'push'
    packagesToPush: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/*.nupkg'
    nuGetFeedType: 'internal'
    publishVstsFeed: '<libraryGuid>'
```

| Argument | Value | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **command** | `push` | |
| **packagesToPush** | `$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/*.nupkg` | The `Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory` is an global variable that Azure Pipelines exposes to indicate the directory where build artifacts are placed |
| **nuGetFeedType** | `internal` | Internal is used if the Artifact is located in the same organization |
| **publishVstsFeed** | `<libraryGuid>` | The GUID that identifies the library.  It's not easy to find, so after you paste the YAML into the editor. Use the assistance to edit the tasks |

## Running the Pipeline

We started this task to get triggered whenever there was a commit to the master branch.  Once we click save in the editor, if you haven't been saving at each task, we will be prompted for a commit message.

* Click the 'Save' button, or 'Save and Run' if you haven't been saving along with the post.
  
![Build and Sign - Save Pipeline](/assets/images/posts/build-sign-save-pipeline.png){: .align-center}

* Enter a commit message
* Any optional text (optional)
* 'Commit directly to the master branch' for this post, should be selected
* Click 'Save'

At this point the commit is being saved and a pipeline run is being triggered. Open up a new tab with the pipeline showing.

![Build and Sign - Pipeline View](/assets/images/posts/build-sign-pipeline-view.png){: .align-center}

You'll see the repository name, 'AwesomeSample' in this case, with the Last Run. This image in front of the repository name indicates the start of the run.  In the case of the image above, it's being queued.  If it fails, you will get an ![red X](/assets/images/posts/azure-red-x.png) . If you click on the commit message, in this case *#20200412.1 - Blog post complete*, you will get to the job details to see what went wrong.  

![Build and Sign - Pipeline Job Failed](/assets/images/posts/build-sign-pipeline-job-failed.png){: .align-center}

This shows us that there was a failure with one of the dotnet.exe tasks.  If you click on the Job below, you can see exactly what happened.

![Build and Sign - Pipeline Job Failed with Details](/assets/images/posts/build-sign-pipeline-job-failed-details.png){: .align-center}

We see that the task '*Build the Assembly*' failed, if you click on it, you will see the details.

This was just for illustration, I had the paths and folders different from what the pipeline scripts were expecting. In addition, I was missing the Visual Studio solution, otherwise you have to update the tasks with folder paths.  If you build is successful, you will see a ![green check mark](/assets/images/posts/azure-green-check.png) to the job. And if you click on the job you'll see ![green check mark](/assets/images/posts/azure-green-check.png) next to all of the tasks.

![Build and Sign - Pipeline Job Success](/assets/images/posts/build-sign-pipeline-success.png){: .align-center}

Oh, and you'll get an email on the success (and failures).

## Checking out the Artifact

Now that we published the package, we can view it in our Artifacts

Click on 'Artifacts' and you will now see the AwesomeSample version 1.0.0-`<builddate>`.`<buildNumber>`-preview.  The version number and name correlates to the values and settings in our csproj as we outlined in the ***Assembly Versioning*** part of this post.

Click on the artifact name and up will get instructions on how to add it to your .NET application via NeGet.  If you click on the 'Versions' button on the toolbar you will see more details about it.

## Creating a 'Release' Build

Some would say that the release builds should be part of workflow, and I agree.  However, we are trying to this in 'one' blog posts.  

* Click on the 'Pipelines' in Azure DevOps
* Click on 'Awesome Sample'
* Click on 'Run Pipeline'

![Build and Sign - Pipeline Run Dialog](/assets/images/posts/build-sign-pipeline-run.png){: .align-center}

You'll see the '*Build Configuration to Use*' parameter that we created earlier.  

* Chose 'Release'
* Click 'Run'

This will take your to the job details page.  Assuming everything runs successfully, you will get a green checkmark and we can see the release build in the Artifacts.

* Click on 'Artifacts'

You'll notice that the 'AwesomeSample' it is now labeled *Version 1.0.0*.  If you click on 'AwesomeSample', then versions,  you'll see 2 versions.  Version 1.0.0 is the currently selected one.

## Wrapping up

That's it! I know that was a lot.  But there was a lot of detail to get us up and running.  If you don't want to piece the whole post together, you can see the gist of azure-pipeline.yml at:

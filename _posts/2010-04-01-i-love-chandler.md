No not Chandler Bing from Friends, although maybe Monica :) … it’s living in Chandler, Arizona.

In the past, I have tried to keep this blog mostly technical but something happened this morning that made me realize I love living in [Chandler, Arizona](http://www.chandleraz.gov "City of Chandler web site."). I forgot to close my garage door last night and during the [City of Chandler Police Departments](http://chandlerpd.com) nightly patrol, the officer closed the door for me and left me a nice little note/reminder. Way to go!

A bit of history… My wife and I spend quite some time researching different cities and parts of the country when deciding where would be the best location (in our opinion) to raise our family. After all the research and talking to some friends and almost family out here we decided to move to Chandler, Arizona. So about 5 years ago in June of 2005, we moved from Long Island, NY and left all our family and friends to move to Chandler, Arizona.

So why do I love living in Chandler, Arizona? There are many reasons. The City of Chandler is proactively looking to grow the City in ways that most cities do not attempt.  The City of Chandler is hosting [Laid Off Camp Phoenix](http://laidoffcampphoenix.com) on April 3rd, 2010.  They attempted to host [Desert Code Camp](http://desertcodecamp.com) on May 15th, 2010 (just not enough time to plan) and they are hosting [Arizona Give Camp](http://azgivecamp.org/Home.aspx) on May 21st-May 23rd, 2010.

The City of Chandler does so much for its citizens, Day of Fun and Fitness, Family Easter celebrations, Chandler Jazz festival,  and [more](http://www.chandleraz.gov/newsreleasearchive.aspx). The City of Chandler has won countless [awards](http://www.chandleraz.gov/default.aspx?pageid=22) also.

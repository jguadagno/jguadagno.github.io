As some of you know, I have the [Southeast Valley .NET User Group](https://www.sevdnug.org/){:target="_blank"} web site running on [Telerik's](https://www.telerik.com/){:target="_blank"} [Sitefinity](https://www.sitefinity.com/){:target="_blank"} product.  The product itself is awesome but needs a few features here an there... One of which is a mechanism to get data into Sitefinity quickly. Luckily, Sitefinity provides a pretty extensive [API](https://www.sitefinity.com/help/developer-manual){:target="_blank"} for you to develop against. So with some free time, the little I have, I put together a Data Importer tool for Sitefinity. This tool will allow you to import data from a Comma Separated file into any Sitefinity generic provider.

The project is open source and available at [https://www.codeplex.com/SEVDNUGDataImporter](https://www.codeplex.com/SEVDNUGDataImporter "https://www.codeplex.com/SEVDNUGDataImporter"){:target="_blank"} please report any problems or feature request there.

Enjoy!

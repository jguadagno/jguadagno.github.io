Phoenix Geek Tag was a minor success so I decided to put together another Geek outing in October. Most likely October 20th starting around 6pm. I have narrowed it down to two places.

**Option 1**: Bowling in Gilbert at [Brunswick Lanes](http://www.bowlbrunswick.com/home/home-center?op=setScratch;scratchName=centerNum;scratchValue=1090)

What's included…

* Bowling with bowling shoes for two hours.
* Drinks (alcoholic and non) are **not included**.
* Food is **not included**.

**Option 2**: [GameWorks](http://www.gameworks.com/?tId=1&sId=14) in Tempe

What's included…

* One or two hour game card (depending on package)
* Private room for socializing and networking
* Choice of 7 different meal options
* Unlimited fountain drinks
* Each person can pay separately for their own extra food / drink.

Leave your comments as to which you prefer. I would like to book the place on Monday.

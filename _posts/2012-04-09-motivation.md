According to the [Bing Dictionary](http://www.bing.com/Dictionary/), [motivation](search?q=define+motivation&qpvt=definition+motivation&FORM=DTPDIA) is defined as follows:

1. **giving of reason to act:** the act of giving somebody a reason or incentive to do something
2. **enthusiasm:** a feeling of enthusiasm, interest, or commitment that makes somebody want to do something, or something that causes such a feeling
3. **reason:** a reason for doing something or behaving in a particular way

Motivation can be a powerful driver to move you forward in your life, goals and/or projects.  For the last few months I have been haphazardly trying to lose some weight, and by haphazardly I mean, that the intent was there just not a lot of motivation. 

That changed two weeks ago at DevConnections when I had two friends of mine comment on my clothing and overall appearance.  One said to my wife, admittedly jokingly, _How can you go out with this guy looking like this when you are so beautiful_ (paraphrasing a bit)? And another making comment while I was working the INETA booth commenting on my attire and general appearance stating (paraphrasing again), _How can you represent INETA looking like that?_ Based on the other comments from that person made thought out the day al,l I heard was _You look like a fat slob!_ And after looking at myself and hearing what some friends were saying to me, I realized that since my mother passed back in October of 09, and taking on the extra community work that I have let myself go.  I tended to wear baggier clothes that were comfortable and I wore sneakers everywhere which was not typical of my style.

Well DevConnections and some friends like [Elijah Manor](http://www.elijahmanor.com/), [loosing 46 pounds](http://www.elijahmanor.com/2012/04/how-programmer-lost-46-pounds-and.html), I am now **motivated** again. I am, as of this morning, 238 pounds and according to most charts and sites based on my height, I should be around 165 pounds although I would be happy with around 180 pounds. So that means I need to lose 58 pounds which I am capable of doing.  In a previous lifestyle change, I lost around 75 pounds.

There are many ways that one can do this; surgery, really restricting my diet, going through crash diets or detox diets. I am probably going to go back to watching what I eat and drink with Weight Watchers. I was really successful with this plan in the past.

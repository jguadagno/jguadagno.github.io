With deep regret, I inform you that we will not be having a Desert Code Camp this year.  There are several reasons for this.  The primary reason is the facility is not available due to the pandemic.  You may be thinking, "But what about going virtual?" I've thought about that, but the beauty of Desert Code Camp is the excellent networking opportunities of an in-person event, which you really can't get virtually.  

The good news is the learning does not need to stop! There are plenty of virtual conferences happening everywhere; many of them are free.  A lot of speakers have started live code coding like me [https://jjg.me/stream](https://jjg.me/stream){:target="_blank"}.

I'll try and get Desert Code Camp kicked off when it is safe to do so.

I hope you understand.

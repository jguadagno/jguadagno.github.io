Plugins are an easy (in most cases) way to add additional functionality to your stream.  Here is a collection of plugins that I use or are considering on using

## Plugins I use

These are plugins that I currently use.

*Empty*, I'm still researching plugins

## Plugins to Research

These are plugins for OBS that I want to research a little more to potentially add to my stream

* [Move Transition](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/move-transition.913/){:target="_blank"} - This provides a smooth transition between objects in your scenes
* [Spectralizer](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/spectralizer.861/){:target="_blank"} - A visualization of the music you are playing.  Think of it as an old school equalizer :smile:
* [Shader Filter](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-shaderfilter-v1-0-update.775/){:target="_blank"} - This plugin provides a shader that can mask the stream, think of frost on a window in the winter.
* [Closed Captioning](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/closed-captioning-via-google-speech-recognition.833/){:target="_blank"} - This plugin uses the Google speech api in real time to provide real time closed captioning for your stream.
* [NDI Setup for Skype](https://support.streamlabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002835654-NDI-Setup-in-Streamlabs-OBS){:target="_blank"} - This is how you can use Skype within OBS to allow for guest streams.  It captures the Skype video as a source in OBS.

## Suggestions

Have any suggestions for plugins for me to give a shot, shoot me an email.

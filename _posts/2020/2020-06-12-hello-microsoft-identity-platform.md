Hello, [Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-4024623){:target="_blank"}!

The team at Microsoft has been working on making Authentication and Authorization easier for us engineers. Since I was close to adding Authentication and Authorization to the [Contacts](https://www.github.com/jguadagno/contacts){:target="_blank"} API that I have been working on on '[Coding with JoeG](https://twitch.tv/jguadagno){:target="_blank"}', [Brady Gaster](https://www.bradygaster.com/) {:target="_blank"}reached out and wanted me to try the new package. I agreed, and we planned for me to implement the package on my stream on June 11th.  It did not go well even though we had [Brady Gaster](https://www.bradygaster.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Christos Matskas](https://cmatskas.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Darrel Miller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrelmiller/){:target="_blank"}, and others helping. You can watch the episode on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/xy1t3EaHOdc){:target="_blank"} if you wish. Part of the reason it did not go well was that I went down a slightly dated documentation rabbit hole, and part of it was 'live' debugging on Twitch, which by the way, had like a 20-30 delay. After 3 hours of trying to figure it out, we called it a night.  However, that did not stop me or the team at Microsoft from figuring out what happened. Both Brady and Christos reached out to me with a solution the following morning that we got working in a few minutes.

I'm going to create a blog post about how we implemented it [here]({% post_url 2020/2020-06-12-protecting-an-asp-net-core-api-with-microsoft-identity-platform %}).  We'll stream the implementation or adding Authentication and Authorization on Monday's stream.

Thanks, Brady, Christos, Darrel, and the team for the assist!

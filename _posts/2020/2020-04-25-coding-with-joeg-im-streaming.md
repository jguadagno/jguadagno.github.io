I'm joining many other technology leaders and public speakers and starting to live code on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/jguadagno){:target="_blank"}... maybe soon to YouTube!

## Content

Like most streams, there is always some theme.  While there will be a lot of Microsoft technologies used, *you go with what you know*, I'm going to try and be platform agnostic. We'll cover topics from beginner to advanced. The goal is to not necessarily teach you every nuisance of a language/tool/technology but to learn, I plan on learning, some common programming practices, and principals. We'll do this by building a contact application from scratch. Start with a clean slate, aka '*File \| New*', and grow the application while following some 'best practices'.  Technologies we'll include in the application include:

* Database
* Unit Tests
* Integration Tests
* Load Tests
* An API
* API management
* Cloud Deployments
* Build Scripts
* and more...

I've outlined how I plan to build this application already. You can check out the outline on [Github](https://github.com/jguadagno/Contacts/blob/master/outline.md){:target="_blank"}.

As we complete tasks, and I post the video(s), I'll update the [outline](https://github.com/jguadagno/Contacts/blob/master/outline.md){:target="_blank"} with links to the video(s) and commit ids.

You can watch the progress of the codebase at [https://github.com/jguadagno/Contacts](https://github.com/jguadagno/Contacts){:target="_blank"}.

### Suggestions

If you want to see a slightly different order or add something to the plan.  Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request){:target="_blank"} (PR) to the [repo](https://github.com/jguadagno/Contacts){:target="_blank"}.

Have additional suggestions for the stream, add an [issue](https://github.com/jguadagno/CodingWithJoeG/issues){:target="_blank"}.

## Schedule

I'm going to start out streaming 3 days a week, Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. I'll start at 7 pm Eastern Daylight Time ([EDT](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/edt){:target="_blank"}), which is currently [UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/aboututc.html){:target="_blank"}-4, due to daylight saving time. When the US is not in daylight savings time, I'll start at 7 pm Eastern Standard Time ([EST](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/est){:target="_blank"}), which is [UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/aboututc.html){:target="_blank"}-5.

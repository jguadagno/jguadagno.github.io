# C# “MVP 2 MVP” Sessions

[MVP](/assets/images/posts/MVP_FullColor_ForScreen.png)

This series of 15 minute "lightening round" sessions will be given by MVPs, for MVPs. It will be an opportunity for MVPs to share things they've learned or showcase what they have created/mastered with .net technologies using C#.

## Schedule

All sessions are scheduled for 15 minutes. There will be 5 minutes in between for Q&A. The sessions will take place Tuesday, March 1 from 2:00pm - 6:00pm in Building 92 - Room Utopia.

## Sessions

### Visualize your data with maps

#### Al Pascual

This session will show how to display information using maps and how they can help visualize your data. You'll see how to create and display a map

### Create an OData Feed in 10 minutes

#### Chris Woodruff

The Open Data Protocol (OData) http://www.odata.org/ is an open protocol for sharing data. It provides a way to break down data silos and increase the shared value of data by creating an ecosystem in which data consumers can interoperate with data producers in a way that is far more powerful than currently possible, enabling more applications to make sense of a broader set of data. Every producer and consumer of data that participates in this ecosystem increases its overall value.

### Using FitNesse with C#

#### Special Guest

### Credit Crunch Code – Paying Back the Technical Debt

#### Gary Short

Technical debt is the debt present in your code when you take architectural or software engineering short cuts, or when you don't make savings against time when you can. At a later date you must return to the code and “pay off” this Technical Debt. Failure to do so can result in the debt accumulating to such an extent that it becomes greater than the “capital” in the code base and the project is then in danger of being cancelled. In this short presentation I'll show you some anti patterns that lead to Technical Debt and the solutions to them, but more importantly, I'll show you how to put a financial value on the debt in your code base so that you can better convince management to allow you to “pay off” the debt.

### Evolving .NET

#### Jason Bock

Evolutionary programming and computation have been used in the past to produce amazing and unexpected designs, yet a lot people don't know how powerful these concepts are. This session will describe these principles and show how you can use them as you develop .NET code by using LINQ expressions.

### WF Dynamic hosting

#### Mezil Matthieu

In this session, we will see how to dynamically host a workflow and how this workflow can drive Silverlight application.

Entity Framework performance tips and tricks  
I realized many audits on Entity Framework, particularly to fix performance issues. In all cases I showed, these are the fault of a bad EF knowledge. In this session, I want to share with you main points I identified to have good performance with LINQ to Entities.

### How to become a conference speaker

#### Paul Litwin

### A lap around Mighty Moose

#### Peter Richie

TDD means we write tests to validate the code we right. This is primarily executed in tools like Visual Studio either manually to run all unit tests (or a class of unit tests)--that generally blocks the developer from continuing their work until all the tests have run--or test running is delayed until code changes are committed to source code control. Continuous testing takes continuous integration to the next level. Continuous testing executes your tests in the background while you continue to work on your project in Visual Studio. Mighty Moose takes it a step further by analyzing code changes, in near real-time, as it is saved; calculates which tests need to be run based on the changed code, and runs them in the background. Failed and passed tests then appear in Visual Studio in the background almost instantly while you continue working on your code--the changes you've made are validated by your unit tests in almost real-time.

### Entity Framework 360: Code-Only Approach

#### Robert Vetter

While most enterprise applications are object-oriented, the data upon which they depend is not. Often, binding these two platforms together can result in significant amounts of lost productivity and a less than optimal solution. Come see how to resolve this recurring theme with the upcoming "code-only" release of the ADO.NET Entity Framework. In this session, we'll… • Dive into the enhancements that the code-only release delivers • Look closely at the new lightweight DbContext and DbSet objects • Demonstrate how to map domain classes to a data store, without explicitly creating a, Entity Data Mode • Examine a clearly defined set of “convention over configuration“ patterns that greatly reduce explicit mapping configuration You'll walk-away with a clear understanding of how the Entity Framework 4.0 can greatly simplify your DAL and enable you to program against a set of domain entities, and not the data store itself.

### Testing Silverlight Applications with Silverlight Unit Test Framework

#### Sergey Barskiy

Any application needs tests written for it, both unit and integration. Silverlight presents its own challenges related to asynchronous nature of Silverlight applications. I will talk about tools that can be used to overcome these challenges. I will show how to use Microsoft Silverlight Unit Test framework to write both synchronous and asynchronous tests for Silverlight apps. I will also cover the use of Moq and mocking in general for unit testing. I will also talk about automating test written with Silverlight unit testing framework.

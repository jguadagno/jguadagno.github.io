## Who we are

Our website address is https://www.josephguadagno.net.

## What personal data we collect and why we collect it

### Comments

When visitors leave comments on the site, we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitor's IP address and browser user agent string to help spam detection. An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the Gravatar service to see if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: https://automattic.com/privacy/. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of your comment.

### Media

If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Visitors to the site can download and extract any location data from images on the website.

### Contact forms

### Cookies

If you leave a comment on our site, you may opt-in to save your name, email address and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year. If you have an account and you log in to this site, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts cookies. This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser. When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen display choices. Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select "Remember Me", your login will persist for two weeks. If you log out of your account, the login cookies will be removed. If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes no personal data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day.

### Embedded content from other websites

Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the same way as if the visitor has visited the other website. These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

### Analytics

## Who we share your data with

## How long we retain your data

If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue. For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.

## What rights you have over your data

If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.

## Where we send your data

Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service.

## Additional information

* * *

### Contact Form

**Data Used:** If [Akismet](https://akismet.com/){:target="_blank"} is enabled on the site, the contact form submission data — IP address, user agent, name, email address, website, and message — is submitted to the [Akismet](https://akismet.com/) service (also owned by [Automattic](https://automattic.com/)){:target="_blank"} for the sole purpose of spam checking. The actual submission data is stored in the database of the site on which it was submitted and is emailed directly to the owner of the form (i.e. the site author who published the page on which the contact form resides). This email will include the submitter's IP address, timestamp, name, email address, website, and message. **Data Synced ([?](https://jetpack.com/support/what-data-does-jetpack-sync/){:target="_blank"}):** Post and post meta data associated with a user's contact form submission. If [Akismet](https://akismet.com/){:target="_blank"} is enabled on the site, the IP address and user agent originally submitted with the comment are synced, as well, as they are stored in post meta.

### Google Analytics

**Data Used:** Please refer to the appropriate [Google Analytics documentation](https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsTrackingOverview#howAnalyticsGetsData){:target="_blank"} for the specific type of data it collects. For sites running [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/){:target="_blank"} (also owned by [Automattic](https://automattic.com/){:target="_blank"}) and this feature simultaneously and having all purchase tracking explicitly enabled, purchase events will send Google Analytics the following information: order number, product id and name, product category, total cost, and quantity of items purchased. Google Analytics does offer [IP anonymization](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en){:target="_blank"}, which can be enabled by the site owner. **Activity Tracked:** This feature sends page view events (and potentially [video play events](https://jetpackme.wordpress.com/support/for-your-privacy-policy/#video-hosting){:target="_blank"}) over to Google Analytics for consumption. For sites running WooCommerce-powered stores, some additional events are also sent to Google Analytics: shopping cart additions and removals, product listing views and clicks, product detail views, and purchases. Tracking for each specific WooCommerce event needs to be enabled by the site owner.

### Gravatar Hovercards

**Data Used:** This feature will send a hash of the user's email address (if logged in to the site or WordPress.com — or if they submitted a comment on the site using their email address that is attached to an active Gravatar profile) to the [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com/){:target="_blank"} service (also owned by [Automattic](https://automattic.com/){:target="_blank"}) in order to retrieve their profile image.

### Jetpack Comments

**Data Used:** Commenter's name, email address, and site URL (if provided via the comment form), timestamp, and IP address. Additionally, a jetpack.wordpress.com IFrame receives the following data: WordPress.com blog ID attached to the site, ID of the post on which the comment is being submitted, commenter's local user ID (if available), commenter's local username (if available), commenter's site URL (if available), MD5 hash of the commenter's email address (if available), and the comment content. If [Akismet](https://akismet.com/) (also owned by [Automattic](https://automattic.com/){:target="_blank"}) is enabled on the site, the following information is sent to the service for the sole purpose of spam checking: commenter's name, email address, site URL, IP address, and user agent. **Activity Tracked:** The comment author's name, email address, and site URL (if provided during the comment submission) are stored in cookies. [Learn more about these cookies](https://jetpack.com/support/cookies/#comments){:target="_blank"}. **Data Synced ([?](https://jetpack.com/support/what-data-does-jetpack-sync/){:target="_blank"}):** All data and metadata (see above) associated with comments. This includes the status of the comment and, if [Akismet](https://akismet.com/){:target="_blank"} is enabled on the site, whether or not it was classified as spam by Akismet.

* * *

### Mobile Theme

**Data Used:** A visitor's preference on viewing the mobile version of a site. **Activity Tracked:** A cookie (`akm_mobile`) is stored for 3.5 days to remember whether or not a visitor of the site wishes to view its mobile version. [Learn more about this cookie](https://jetpack.com/support/cookies/#mobile-theme){:target="_blank"}.

### Protect

**Data Used:** In order to check login activity and potentially block fraudulent attempts, the following information is used: attempting user's IP address, attempting user's email address/username (i.e. according to the value they were attempting to use during the login process), and all IP-related HTTP headers attached to the attempting user. **Activity Tracked:** Failed login attempts (these include IP address and user agent). We also set a cookie (`jpp_math_pass`) for 1 day to remember if/when a user has successfully completed a math captcha to prove that they're a real human. [Learn more about this cookie.](https://jetpack.com/support/cookies/#protect){:target="_blank"} **Data Synced ([?](https://jetpack.com/support/what-data-does-jetpack-sync/){:target="_blank"}):** Failed login attempts, which contain the user's IP address, attempted username or email address, and user agent information.

* * *

### Sharing

**Data Used:** When sharing content via email (this option is only available if [Akismet](https://akismet.com/){:target="_blank"} is active on the site), the following information is used: sharing party's name and email address (if the user is logged in, this information will be pulled directly from their account), IP address (for spam checking), user agent (for spam checking), and email body/content. This content will be sent to [Akismet](https://akismet.com/){:target="_blank"} (also owned by [Automattic](https://automattic.com/){:target="_blank"}) so that a spam check can be performed. Additionally, if [reCAPTCHA](http://www.google.com/recaptcha){:target="_blank"} (by Google) is enabled by the site owner, the sharing party's IP address will be shared with that service. You can find Google's privacy policy [here](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/){:target="_blank"}.

### WordPress.com Stats

**Data Used:** IP address, WordPress.com user ID (if logged in), WordPress.com username (if logged in), user agent, visiting URL, referring URL, timestamp of event, browser language, country code. _Important:_ The site owner does **not** have access to any of this information via this feature. For example, a site owner can see that a specific post has 285 views, but he/she cannot see which specific users/accounts viewed that post. Stats logs — containing visitor IP addresses and WordPress.com usernames (if available) — are retained by [Automattic](https://automattic.com/){:target="_blank"} for 28 days and are used for the sole purpose of powering this feature. **Activity Tracked:** Post and page views, [video plays](https://jetpackme.wordpress.com/support/for-your-privacy-policy/#video-hosting) {:target="_blank"}(if videos are hosted by WordPress.com), outbound link clicks, referring URLs and search engine terms, and country. When this module is enabled, Jetpack also tracks performance on each page load that includes the Javascript file used for tracking stats. This is exclusively for aggregate performance tracking across Jetpack sites in order to make sure that our plugin and code is not causing performance issues. This includes the tracking of page load times and resource loading duration (image files, Javascript files, CSS files, etc.). The site owner has the ability to force this feature [to honor DNT settings of visitors](https://jetpack.com/support/wordpress-com-stats/#honoring-dnt){:target="_blank"}. By default, DNT is currently not honored.

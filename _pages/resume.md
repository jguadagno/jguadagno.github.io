## Experience

### Real Time Technologies (RT²)

Remote
_9/2023 to Present_

#### Vice President of IT

*Fill in responsibilities here*

### Rocket Mortgage

Detroit, MI
_8/2013 to 8/2023_

#### Senior Director in Engineering - 1/2019 to 8/2023

As a Senior Director, I am responsible for the growth of the products I own and the growth of my teams along with their team members. I started in the position with two teams, fourteen team members and three products. Our team has since grown to five teams, fifty-five people and over fifteen products. The growth of about 400% of the team and products was done seamlessly through leadership and the work that was done to enable it. Along with my leadership team, we established some common processes to enable the stability of our applications with enabled us to grow. Some processes included onboarding processes for new team members to ensure they had the right tools and processes to effectively do their role. We standardized the deployment process across all our products, which includes change processes, documentation, and testing. This change process enabled the team to increase the number of deployments by over 500% from the start of the year.

I enabled and encouraged Team Member growth through training. We have quarterly team training goals to level up the team. Through experimentation, we frequently try new things to tweak/improve our processes including Mob Programming, Machine Learning, Reorganizing the teams based on projects and skill sets, and trying out new tools.

We have also been a fully remote, location-aware, team prior to Covid. My team members are split between two different offices (in two time zones) along with multiple time zones in the US. This remote team works well because of what is done to keep the team connected. We have "fun rooms" in Teams, life celebrations (new children, birthday, anniversary, etc.), theme weeks, and more.

Outside the 'day to day' roles and responsibilities of being a Senior Director, I also mentor other Directors and leaders looking to improve their skills set and advance in leadership. I am also an international public speaker, who speaks on multiple technology topics and is an active blogger. I also am active in the community to educate people and help with brand awareness.

#### Team Leader – 1/2014 to 1/2019

As a Team Leader, I lead a team of Business Analysts, Quality Assurance Engineers, Software Engineers, and a Software Architect to deliver several quality projects.

My team built a service that allows our clients to automatically gather, with their permission, Asset, Income, and Income Tax data and forms from our partners to include in their mortgage application. For the work and creativity for this product, I was awarded U.S. Patent #[10,042,949](http://jjg.me/patent)

Another project was a new, reimagined, Sales Force automation system. This system was redesigned from the ground up to help our bankers' collect data from our clients during the mortgage process. My tasks included: discovery, project estimation, application architecture, status reporting, and presentations on the progress of the project.

Although not part of my day-to-day work:

- I participate in several virtual teams, including the Open-Source Big Rock team.
- The Open-Source Big Rock team&#39;s goal was to get an open-source mind set at work, and to create a culture of being able to jump in and contribute code to projects and applications that you do not normally work on.
- I also help mentor other leaders, both new and seasoned.
- I do this by having one on ones with them where we talk about the challenges we are having together.
- I also was part of the Technology Public Relations team as well as the .NET Interviewers team.
- I helped organize the Quicken Loans Technology conference for around 1200 team members.
- This conference had 3 tracks with 2 keynotes and 15 sessions.
- I also participate in a team to investigate the future and figure out what we need to do to make are systems and processes better for our clients and our team members.

#### Software Architect – 8/2013 to 1/2014

As a Software Architect, I was brought onto a net-new project that was being managed by another company to assist with its design and development. During this project, I moved into the role of technical lead on the application to fill the void left once the contract was up with the other company. My tasks included: mentoring fellow team members, assigning development tasks, attending planning meetings, coordinating efforts with other teams, performing code reviews, and helping to design the SDLC process for the team. The project had a successful pilot launch, and several successful launches throughout its lifespan. As our team was transitioning this project to another team, for continued development and support, I trained the other team on the application, solution, and workflow as well as provided development support as they ramped up.

I have provided several training events and presentations to fellow team members on topics such as "Debugging Applications", Twitter Bootstrap, ReSharper, and many more.

### IO

Phoenix, AZ
_1/2013 to 8/2013_

#### Senior Software Engineer

As a Senior Software Engineer, I was tasked with doing research, design, and discovery for new features or products to add to the company's offerings. I was also tasked with researching existing problems and looking for solutions to them. I presented at several "Lunch and Learns" to teach fellow software developers modern technology.

One of my other tasks was to help set the standard and best practices for development. This included improving the current software development standards documentation, establishing processes for software development, and choosing the right tools to help with the process.

### Wells Fargo

Chandler, AZ
_2006 to 1/2013_

#### Technology Advisor

As the Technology Advisor, I was charged with creating and implementing development coding standards,
As the Technology Advisor, I was charged with creating and implementing development coding standards, development best practices, and common development software for the Technology Operations group, approximately four hundred developers. In addition, I acted as the internal developer evangelist for Microsoft development technologies. I provided several internal training classes on architecture and development for groups ranging from 5 to 200 people. I was tasked as a "hired gun" to join troubled projects to fix them up and/or help projects that were stumped with implementation or integration technologies. I implemented an internal NuGet server for common and internal libraries.

#### Technology Lead

I was the lead developer for several internal applications as well as third party implementation projects.

I sat on the Source Code Control Advisory committee tasked with setting the standards for Source Code Control standards for the entire bank. I assisted in the implementation of the Enterprise Microsoft Team Foundation Server.

I implemented a metric reporting system, which consumed data from multiple locations, performed calculations on those metrics, and then displayed them on screen. To accomplish this, I implemented a pluggable framework which loads and schedules .NET assemblies dynamically to consume feeds from multiple locations and perform the calculations.

I also started an internal .NET user group to provide education on .NET technologies, standardization of tools, and built out an internal community.

I improved the performance and reliability of the "CORE" application. This application used a custom threading library, custom TCP/IP messaging of ClearQuest objects to automate the movement of defects and code packages through the ClearQuest workflow. The CORE system generates approximately 300 error messages a day. After a month of debugging and coding, the error messages were reduced to one or two a week.

Created a custom ADO.NET provider and SQL client application for querying the ClearQuest data store using SQL syntax. This involved the parsing of incoming SQL requests (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT) and converting them to the corresponding ClearQuest API calls.

Created a web service for queries to the ClearQuest data store using either web services protocols or JavaScript objects.

For many of these applications, I generated unit test and executed them with NUnit and added additional logging with log4net.

Another project that I created was a custom task scheduler, like that of the Windows Scheduler, with a few exceptions. This application allowed the user to create a task using any .NET language. Once created the plug-in or task would be placed in the plug-ins folder and on the next restart of the scheduler the plug-in would be loaded and executed based on its schedule.

Created custom CodeSmith templates, a CodeSmith SQLite schema provider, and a CodeSmith template to generate NUnit tests for an existing .NET assembly.

### Intel Corporation

Chandler, AZ
_1/2006 to 6/2006_

#### Lead Software Developer

As part of the Flex Services Technical Operations team (TechOps), I was tasked to improve the performance and reliability of one of Flex Services' internal billing sites. This web site supports 600 users across the globe. Application performance was dramatically improved (search speeds when from 3 minutes for 600 records to 3-17 seconds for 1200 records), page load times when from 45-60 to about 5 seconds. The user interface was also improved dramatically by using Ajax technology to dynamically load pages (or sections of) when needed. The security, menu and database interfaces were improved. I was also tasked with reviewing third party developed code to ensure it was following general programming requirements and design.

I also created a dynamic reporting application, which used reflection to see a list of available reports. In conjunction with this reporting application a Microsoft Excel add-in was created to merge cells in a spreadsheet programmatically.

#### Development Manager and Manager of Imaging Practice

I managed a team of four people which includes: one project manager, one business analyst, one support person / system administrator, and one developer. Management tasks include handling day to day personnel issues, assigning work to people, ensuring that work is complete, and performing semiannual reviews. Daily tasks include creating status reports, attending status meetings, supporting existing systems, designing new systems, and gathering requirements.

I also looked for ways to optimize the current applications by re-architecting them as newer technologies come out. Examples include Redesigning Kofax Batch Classes, using new components/technologies that became available.

Some of the day-to-day programming tasks included: designing Kofax Batch Classes, modifying OCR for AnyDoc templates, modifying the Web site and components that have been created, creating Kofax release scripts, and recognition scripts.

Some of the accomplishments I achieved while being the manager of the imaging practice included:

- Created a conversion application to take documents out of Optika and place them in a FileNet repository.
- Create a secure remote scanning facility, which allows Guardian's agencies to scan documents and transmit them securely to the central capture area.

- Served as a member of the Enterprise Architecture team to create a framework for the company using .NET technologies.

#### Project Manager

From _12/1998 to 7/2005_

I managed a project for Guardian's Individual Market profit center. This application was designed to enable faster underwriting of the insurance applications. This was accomplished by having the agencies scan or fax in their application to our capture system which in term indexed them for storage in the FileNet repository. I was responsible for getting the project approved, designed, developed, implemented, and supported. The project team consisted of 4 developers, 1 DBA, 1 system administrator, and me. I managed this project from end to end.

I started on the team as the lead developer, but I quickly became the project manager to build the Billing Information Storage and Retrieval System that is currently in production. While working on the team my responsibilities entailed: installing and configuring a FileNet Image Services server, implementing a Datacap capture system, creating a Visual Basic front end, and an Intranet based front end to query the FileNet repository. I also built several scripts for retrieving a data file from the corporate mainframe and uploading it to the Oracle validation database. I was also responsible for training all the users in the administration and use of the BISAR system. Other responsibilities included evaluating other capture and imaging products for use in production. In building the Intranet application to query the FileNet repository, I designed and developed a connection pooler to FileNet. The connection pooler ran as an NT service and handled multiple requests coming in FileNet connections. This saved the company over $400k in licensing fees. The connection pooler was able to use 15 connections to support over 300 users. I created an imaging framework that sat on top of the FileNet API, to provide easier, more object oriented, access to the FileNet repository. With this Intranet application, I built a suite of FileNet Visual Basic COM wrappers that accept parameters and return results as XML documents.

I headed the development team for an imaging workflow project for Park Avenue Securities. With this system I designed the backend workflow database and form data storage. I was also responsible for designing and developing over 10 components for interacting with FileNet, CereSoft and SQL server. These components performed data validation, data verification and workflow routing. I also had to build a custom SGML parser to read export files. Project Life Cycle: Full Cycle.

I also worked on the Online Electronic Forms Repository project. For this project, I created a prototype Internet site where people can search through a database of forms that the Guardian had to offer. I was also involved in many vendor meetings to determine which vendor application met the needs of this project. For the production system, I design the backend database for the forms repository.

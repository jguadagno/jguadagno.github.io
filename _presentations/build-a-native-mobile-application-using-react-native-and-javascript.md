React Native lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript.
It uses the same design as React, letting you compose a rich mobile UI from declarative components.

With React Native, you don't build a “mobile web app,” an “HTML5 app”, or a “hybrid app.”
You create a real mobile app that's indistinguishable from an app built using Objective-C or Java.
React Native uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps.
You just put those building blocks together using JavaScript and React.

C# brings you the power to write apps on any platform, like Windows, Linux, and macOS.  However, when it comes to building an application with a user interface, you usually must resort to the lowest common denominator, JavaScript, or multiple tools like Xamarin, Blazor, etc. Now you have a new option to build pixel-perfect user interfaces using C# and Windows Xaml. That option is the Uno Platform.  The Uno Platform allows you to write your application in .NET C# and XAML using a single-codebase and execute it everywhere .NET runs â€“ iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, Linux, and Web (via WebAssembly). Oh, I forgot to mention, the Uno Platform is free and open source. You can use the existing controls ecosystem with it.

In this talk, I'll walk you through getting started with development on the Uno Platform.  We'll start with setting up the development machine and start coding.  Once the environment is set up, I'll use the platform to build an application that interacts with an existing Contact API to list, add, delete, and update contacts.

At the end of this talk, you will know to develop an application that calls an API and provides a consistent, platform-specific user interface.

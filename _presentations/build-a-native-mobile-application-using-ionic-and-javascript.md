Ionic lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript.
The [Ionic framework](https://ionicframework.com/){:target="_blank"} is a free and open-source library of mobile-optimized HTML, 
CSS, and JS components along with tools for building highly interactive native and progressive web apps.
It is made with Sass, optimized for AngularJS.

In this session, you will see how you can build rich, powerful,
robust mobile applications that are clean, simple, and functional.
These applications can use [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/){:target="_blank"},
[PhoneGap](https://phonegap.com/){:target="_blank"} to deploy natively or be a modern-day web application.

All you need for this session is to know are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: the building blocks of the web.
You'll even learn AngularJS as you work with Ionic and this talk.

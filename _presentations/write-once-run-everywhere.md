The open-source Ionic Framework features a rich library of front-end building blocks and UI components that make it easy to design beautiful, high-performance mobile and Progressive Web Apps (or PWAs) using HTML technologies, CSS, and JavaScript.

Their universal web components pair with any JavaScript framework, including Angular, React, Vue, or no framework at all (just add a script tag!). Ionic apps are backend agnostic, with connections to AWS, Azure, and Firebase.

With this session, we will look at how with using the Ionic Framework, you can build an application that you write once and run on any device, iOS, Android, UWA, Browser, and desktop.

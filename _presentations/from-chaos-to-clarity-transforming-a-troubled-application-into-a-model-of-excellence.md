Applications riddled with errors, inefficiencies, and poor support can frustrate users and drain resources. But what if that struggling application could be transformed into an example of reliability, scalability, and performance? This talk will walk you through the journey of revitalizing a flawed application—tackling performance bottlenecks, eliminating critical errors, and implementing best practices for sustainable development and support.  

Beyond technical improvements, the success of any application transformation hinges on people—leaders who inspire, teams who collaborate, and a culture that embraces growth and accountability. We'll talk about strategies for fostering an engineering culture built on trust, knowledge-sharing, and continuous improvement. How do you rally a team around a shared vision for excellence? What leadership principles encourage ownership and innovation? From communication tactics to empowerment strategies, we’ll explore how to lead teams through change and build a support ecosystem that doesn’t just fix problems but prevents them.  

Attendees will gain insights into identifying root causes of instability, adopting robust architectural principles, and fostering a proactive support culture. We'll discuss real-world strategies for refactoring code, optimizing infrastructure, and building a resilient operational framework that ensures ongoing success. Whether you're facing technical debt, unpredictable outages, or a lack of documentation, this session will provide practical guidance to shift your application from liability to legacy.  

By the end of this talk, developers, architects, and IT professionals will walk away with actionable approaches to rescue troubled applications and elevate them to the standard of excellence every system should strive for—driven by strong leadership and an empowered, engaged team.

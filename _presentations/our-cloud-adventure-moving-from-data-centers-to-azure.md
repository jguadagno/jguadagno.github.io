Join me as I share our journey of transitioning to Azure from on-premises data centers. This transition presented not only technical challenges as well as a paradigm shift in our way of working.

Technology is evolving at a rapid pace. To keep up, many organizations are moving from traditional data centers to the cloud. Our organization embarked on a significant journey to migrate our systems and data to Microsoft Azure.

In this session, we'll discuss the importance of training programs in preparing our team for the shift. We'll explore the process of evaluating existing resources, managing applications in the cloud, and fostering a culture of continuous learning. We'll share how effective team communication became paramount, as did working with external consultants to bring in extra hands. We faced the dual challenge of setting reasonable versus unreasonable expectations while ensuring the protection of data access, security, and integrity throughout the migration process.

Licensing issues had to be navigated carefully, and we restructured our architecture to become larger, thus enhancing resiliency. The shift to a cloud-based infrastructure meant we had much more to monitor and alert on, highlighting the importance of identifying the weakest links in our system.

Part of our process involved finding areas susceptible to hacking, whether through people, accounts, or network vulnerabilities. In this talk, we will share our experiences, the lessons learned, and the new way of working that has emerged from our migration to Azure.

Overall, we'll explore the challenges we faced, the lessons we learned, and the benefits we gained from this transformation. If you're considering a move to the cloud, this session will provide valuable insights and practical tips to help you successfully navigate the transition.

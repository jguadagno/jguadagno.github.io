Today’s cloud-native applications are speaking volumes—and with OpenTelemetry, you can finally listen. In this session, we’ll explore how Azure Application Insights and OpenTelemetry work together to provide deep, end-to-end visibility into your app’s performance, reliability, and user experience.

You'll learn how to:

- Instrument your application with OpenTelemetry for custom telemetry and distributed tracing
- Integrate telemetry into Azure Application Insights to unlock powerful diagnostics
- Use query tools and dashboards to slice, dice, and visualize the data that matters most
- Troubleshoot bottlenecks, latency issues, and unexpected behavior using telemetry correlation
- Apply OpenTelemetry best practices to improve observability in multi-service architectures

Whether you're wrangling microservices or just trying to figure out why your app is acting weird, you’ll walk away with practical tools and a clearer picture of what’s going on under the hood.

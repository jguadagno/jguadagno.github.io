What if getting up and running with distributed .NET apps didn’t feel like assembling IKEA furniture blindfolded? Say hello to .NET Aspire, a toolkit that trims the complexity and lets you focus on what matters: building great software, faster.

In this talk, I’ll show you how Aspire helps new developers to your project hit the ground running and seasoned teams stay aligned. We’ll walk through how to add Aspire to an existing application, from set up to integration, and highlight some real wins along the way. With built-in support for service discovery, observability, and local orchestration, Aspire takes care of the plumbing so you can focus on solving real problems. We’ll cover how you can use it to cut onboarding time and reduce “dev friction”, all while keeping code clean and architecture consistent.

Expect practical tips, a few “aha!” moments, and a fresh look at what modern .NET development can be. Whether you're leading a dev team or mentoring new talent, Aspire might just become your secret weapon.

Ionic lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript. The [Ionic framework](https://ionicframework.com/){:target="_blank"} is a free and open source library of mobile-optimized HTML, CSS and JS components along with tools for building highly interactive native and progressive web apps. Built with Sass, optimized for AngularJS.

In this session, we'll introduce you to the Ionic Framework.  We'll cover what the framework is, how you set up your development environment, what makes up the framework and the pieces of the framework.  After this, you'll be well on your way to building your first mobile application with the Ionic Framework.

In this session, we will walk through all of the new features added to ASP.NET4.5 with respect to data binding and control validation.

In ASP.NET 4.5, Web Forms includes some improvements for working with data. The first improvement is strongly typed data controls. The second improvement is model binding which extends data binding in ASP.NET Web Forms controls to work with code-focused data access. It incorporates concepts from the ObjectDataSource control and from model binding in ASP.NET MVC.

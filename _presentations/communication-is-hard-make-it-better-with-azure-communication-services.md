We live in a connected world, and we are constantly communicating with people via text, phone, video, chat, and more. Azure Communication Services offers a robust suite of APIs for integrating voice, video, chat, SMS, and email into applications, enabling developers to build powerful, cloud-based communication solutions.

In this talk, we will look at how Azure Communication Services can enable you and your applications to connect people across web and mobile apps. You can add communications workflows to applications with flexible SDKs and APIs for common platforms and languages, including iOS, Android, Web, .NET, and JavaScript.

I'll show you how to build a chat application, and an SMS application using Azure Communication Services. We'll also look at how to build a UI library to make it easier to integrate Azure Communication Services into your applications.

Attendees will leave with an understanding of how Azure Communication Services can be used to enhance their applications and improve user engagement.

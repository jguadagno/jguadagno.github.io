Building a talk or session or presentation for an event, whether it's your team at work, a user group, a small or sizeable in-person conference, or a virtual event, takes work and preparation. How are you going to create the content for the talk?  What do you need to do to prepare? What do you do during the event? What happens if someone asks me a question, I do not know the answer to it? What should I do after the talk? There is a lot the goes into preparing for a conference talk, session, or presentation.

In this talk, we'll walk through the tips and tricks that I have developed over the years to make my conference talks better.

This talk is similar to the [Presentation Preparedness](presentation-preparedness.md) talk.

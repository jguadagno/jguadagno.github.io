Bootstrap is a “Sleek, intuitive, and powerful mobile-first front-end framework for faster and easier web development.” Let's see how using Bootstrap can make your website come alive with little work. We'll cover how you can get started/add Bootstrap to your site, either new or existing site. We'll talk about the Bootstrap layout framework, better known as the grid system.  We will also talk about the typography, tables, lists, buttons, and the responsive Bootstrap framework.  We'll also look at some third-party themes that can customize your instance of Bootstrap even more.

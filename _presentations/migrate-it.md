Technology is constantly changing. Lately, it's been changing fast. Microsoft has shown the road map for .NET, which has major version releases every year. If you are like me, you have a few applications around running on .NET Framework but not sure how to "upgrade", "port", or "migrate" to .NET. That's where this session comes in.

In this talk, we'll work on "upgrading", "porting", "migrating" an ASP.NET 4.5 framework application that uses Web Forms to a modern ASP.NET Core MVC application.  While migrating the application, we'll explore some of the gotchas, some of the things you should watch out for, some of the new features of .NET, and more.

After this talk, you will be better equipped to tackle that application migration, assuming you get budget and priority approval :)

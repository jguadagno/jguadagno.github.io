ASP.NET Core is a newish open-source and cross-platform framework for building modern cloud-based internet-connected applications, such as web apps, IoT applications, and mobile back ends. ASP.NET Core apps can run on [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core/platform) or on full .NET Framework. You can develop and run your ASP.NET Core apps cross-platform on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

We’ll do a quick overview of ASP.NET Core, then we’ll build an application or two using web API, web UI, and ASP.NET Core MVC.

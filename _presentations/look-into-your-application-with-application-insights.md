Azure Application Insights, part of the Azure Monitor services, helps you collect, analyze, and act on telemetry data from your Azure and on-premises environment.

Let's see how you can get alerts on performance and availability issues, monitor our applications' usage and performance, get telemetry for our application without redeploying the applications, search traces, and exception logs to figure out what is wrong. Did I mention we can monitor Android, iOS, Windows Mobile applications, and ASP.NET applications?

We'll also look at how we can analyze request load, server performance counters, and response times across dependencies. Get multi-dimensional analyzes over standard metrics or define your own. Diagnose exceptions, mobile application crashes, and failed requests, correlating with events and traces.

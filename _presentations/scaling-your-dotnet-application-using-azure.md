Azure provides a lot of services! Azure provides scalable, durable cloud storage, backup, and recovery solutions for any data, large and small. Azure also provides compute services like App Service to create applications in the code, and Azure Functions to build event-driven "server-less" code with ease. Azure can easily work with the infrastructure and application you already have to enhance your existing applications and business continuity strategy cost-effectively.

In this talk, let's take a look at how we can take an existing .NET application and leverage some of Azure's services to improve the reliability, scalability, and performance of our application.  We'll introduce some key and common Azure services like Azure Functions, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Table Storage, Azure Queues, and more. We'll even add some application monitoring and telemetry to that application using Azure Monitor Application Insights so you can see how the application is performing and being used.

By the end of this talk, you'll be exposed to some of the most common... and simplest ways... to make your application reliable, scalable, and performant.
